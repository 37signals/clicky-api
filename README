Clicky-api is a Ruby Gem which interfaces with version 4 of the Clicky web 
analytics API, documented at http://getclicky.com/help/api.

Usage:

ClickyAPI.set_params!(params={})

  Sets the given parameters persistently, in a class variable (so the 
  settings are applied globally).  Setting the Clicky site_id and sitekey 
  here is a good idea.
  
ClickyAPI.get_params

  Returns the current hash of persistent params set by #set_params!.
  This hash may be manipulated directly, e.g. to delete keys; if you 
  need to alter it without affecting ClickyAPI everywhere, make a copy.
  
ClickyAPI.load_config_file!(file=nil)

  Loads the given YAML config file and passes its keys and values to 
  #set_params!.  If no file is specified and you're using Rails, 
  #load_config_file! will use the contents of "config/clicky-api.yml".

ClickyAPI.stats(params={})

  Queries the Clicky server with the given params, merging them with 
  any parameters set with #set_params!.  Returns a Ruby hash representation 
  of the response.
